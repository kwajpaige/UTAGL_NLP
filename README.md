The vast majority of data in the world today is text within unstructured data - which constitutes up to 80% of the total data generated in the world these days. The rise in data and computing power has driven tremendous developments in the machine learning space, and the need to access and process text data is turning out to be increasingly significant with regards to solving real-life/business problems. The class of techniques used to process and understand various aspects of unstructured text data, is called Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The purpose of this project is to apply NLP to Twitter data in order to understand the sentiment of Twitter customers

## Background
Twitter possesses 330 million monthly active users, which allows businesses to reach a broad population and connect with customers without intermediaries. On the other hand, there’s so much information that it’s difficult for brands to quickly detect negative social mentions that could harm their business.
That's why sentiment analysis/classification, which involves monitoring emotions in conversations on social media platforms, has become a key strategy in social media marketing.
Listening to how customers feel about the product/service on Twitter allows companies to understand their audience, keep on top of what’s being said about their brand and their competitors, and discover new trends in the industry.
